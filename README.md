      Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic brain training game developed as part of the '100 Days of SwiftUI' course. This project focuses on challenging players to win or lose at the traditional game of scissors, paper, rock, enhancing decision-making skills under pressure.

## Features
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Players must choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors and aim to win or lose based on the app's prompt.
- **Dynamic Rounds**: Each game round randomly selects a move and sets a goal to win or lose, making every round unpredictable and exciting.
- **Score Tracking**: Tracks the user's score across rounds, rewarding correct decisions and deducting for incorrect ones.
- **Interactive UI**: The app employs custom button designs and vibrant gradients to create an engaging user interface.

## Technical Highlights
- **SwiftUI Views and Modifiers**: Utilized `VStack`, `Group`, `ForEach` for layout, along with custom modifiers for button design.
- **Game Logic**: Implemented core game logic, handling user selections against randomly generated moves by the app.
- **State Management**: Used `@State` properties to manage game states like user score, game moves, and round outcomes.
- **Custom Binding**: Demonstrated the use of custom bindings to manage game states and user interactions.

## Learning Notes
- **Understanding SwiftUI's View System**: Gained a deeper understanding of SwiftUI's use of structs for views and the importance of the order of modifiers.
- **View Composition**: Explored the composition of views and how to use SwiftUI's environment modifiers effectively.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applied ternary operators for conditional UI rendering based on game state.
- **Custom View Modifiers**: Developed skills in creating reusable view modifiers for consistent UI design.

Note: This app was a challenge project from the "100 Days of SwiftUI" course, designed and implemented by me as a part of my iOS development learning journey.
